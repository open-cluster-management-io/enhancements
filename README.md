# Open Cluster Management Enhancement Proposals

This repository contains enhancement proposals for [Open Cluster Management](https://open-cluster-management.io/), a community-driven project focused on multicluster and multicloud scenarios for Kubernetes.

## What This Repository Is For

This repository serves as the central location for proposing, discussing, and tracking significant new features and improvements to Open Cluster Management. Enhancement proposals provide a structured way for the community to collaborate on the evolution of the project.

## Enhancement Process

Enhancement proposals follow a process inspired by the [Kubernetes enhancement](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) process. This repository provides a place for the community to discuss, debate, and reach consensus on how new features are introduced to Open Cluster Management.

Enhancements may take multiple releases to complete and form the basis of the community roadmap. Anyone in the community may propose enhancements, but they require consensus from the relevant project maintainers to be implemented.

For template references and guidelines, see the [enhancement template](guidelines/README.md).

## Is My Thing an Enhancement?

Consider creating an enhancement proposal if your idea:

- Would be worth writing a blog post about after release
- Requires significant effort or introduces substantial changes
- Impacts upgrade or downgrade processes  
- Requires coordination across multiple repositories or domains
- Introduces API changes or graduates between stability levels
- Will be noticed by users and become something they rely on

You probably don't need an enhancement proposal if your work:

- Fixes a bug
- Adds more testing
- Refactors code that only affects internal implementation
- Has minimal impact on the project as a whole

If you're unsure whether your proposed work requires an enhancement, file an issue and ask the community.

## When to Create a New Enhancement

Create an enhancement proposal after you have:

- Shared your idea with the community to gauge interest
- Optionally created a prototype to validate the concept
- Identified people willing to work on and maintain the enhancement
- Recognized that the work may span multiple releases

## Why Track Enhancements

As Open Cluster Management evolves, it's important for the community to understand how we build, test, and document new capabilities. Enhancement proposals help ensure the community can collaborate effectively on design and implementation before significant development work begins.

## Participating in Enhancement Discussions

Please comment on enhancement issues to:
- Request clarification on the process
- Update the status of enhancement efforts  
- Link to related issues in other repositories

For detailed design discussions, use linked issues or design pull requests rather than the main enhancement issue.
