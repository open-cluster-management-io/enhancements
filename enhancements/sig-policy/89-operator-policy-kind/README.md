## Summary

Enhance the policy framework with a new kind, `OperatorPolicy`, to allow for better management of
OLM Operator installations on managed clusters. The controller for this kind would be included in
the configuration-policy-controller container, on managed clusters. Compared to current solutions,
the new kind and controller will provide more control and insight into the version of the operator
being managed, more feedback in the policy status regarding the operator's health, and more
integrated support for uninstallation scenarios.

## Motivation

It is currently possible to install OLM Operators on managed clusters with `ConfigurationPolicies`,
but multiple policies are often required, and these require the policy author to have a deep
understanding of the OLM resources being managed. For example, the policy author might need to
consider whether an OperatorGroup must be created, and incorrectly creating multiple OperatorGroups
can cause operator installations to fail. If the policy author wants to monitor the health of the
operator, they would need to create policies to monitor things like the status of the Subscription
(which can not necessarily be incorporated into the policy to create the Subscription), and related
resources which the operator manages like Deployments. Upgrading or uninstalling the operator would
require additional policies, and the status feedback from `ConfigurationPolicies` might not provide
enough useful information when things do not go according to plan in these scenarios, requiring
manual intervention from an admin.

A new controller can handle the relationships between resources better, for example knowing when an
OperatorGroup should be created, or identifying the Deployments and CustomResourceDefinitions
managed by a ClusterServiceVersion. This information could be incorporated into the policy status,
helping administrators understand the status of the operators from the hub cluster. The new kind can
also provide new controls over the upgrades and uninstallation of these operators, which would be
difficult with current solutions.

### Goals

1. It should be easy to install an operator on a managed cluster with just one policy.
2. It should be possible to specify what upgrades should be allowed performed on an operator.
3. The policy status should report on the health of the operator, both the OLM resources like the
   Subscription, as well as the associated Deployments.
4. The policy should report when the CatalogSource for the operator is unhealthy. It should be
   configurable whether this will cause the policy to become NonCompliant.
5. It should be possible to remove an operator installation with a policy. Exactly which resources
   are removed should be configurable to match what the user wants: by default only the Subscription
   and ClusterServiceVersion will be removed (matching the suggestion from OLM) but additionally
   things like the CustomResourceDefinitions or InstallPlans could be removed.

### Non-Goals

1. The installation of OLM on managed clusters will not be automated by this enhancement.
2. Management of "Operands" will not be included in this new type - they should be defined in
   separate `ConfigurationPolicies`, possibly with a
   [dependency](../74-order-policy-execution/README.md) on the `OperatorPolicy`. ("Operand" here
   refers to resources that would be created by a user, and managed by the operator, eg instances of
   CRDs which are defined by the operator.)
3. Creation of `CatalogSources` will not be included in the new type - they should be defined in
   separate `ConfigurationPolicies`.

## Proposal

### OperatorPolicy Syntax

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-operator
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce # or inform
  severity: medium
  complianceType: musthave # or mustnothave
  operatorGroup: # optional
    name: my-operator-group
    namespace: own-namespace
    target:
      namespaces:
        - foo
        - bar
    # selector: # One of selector or namespaces is allowed.
    #   matchLabels: # or matchExpressions
    #     mydomain.io/prod: "true"
    serviceAccountName: my-og-account # optional
  subscription:
    config: {} # optional
    channel: stable
    name: my-operator
    namespace: own-namespace
    source: my-catalog
    sourceNamespace: my-catalog-namespace
    startingCSV: my-operator.v0.1.0 # optional
  versions:
    - my-operator.v0.1.1
    - my-operator.v0.2.0
  upgradeApproval: Automatic # or None
  removalBehavior:
    operatorGroups: DeleteIfUnused
    subscriptions: Delete
    clusterServiceVersions: Delete
    installPlans: Keep
    customResourceDefinitions: Keep
  complianceConfig:
    catalogSourceUnhealthy: Compliant
    deploymentsUnavailable: NonCompliant
    upgradesAvailable: Compliant
```

When `remediationAction` is set to `inform`, no actions (creates, deletes, updates) will be taken on
any resources, but the current state may be *read* to identify if the operator is installed as
specified. When resources are missing, the policy will be NonCompliant, with a message specifying
what is missing, and that it will not be created because the policy is not being enforced. When it
is set to `enforce`, OperatorGroups and Subscriptions may be created by the controller, InstallPlans
may be approved, and resources may be removed when the policy is deleted.

The `complianceType` is either "musthave" or "mustnothave" and follows the idea of the same field in
ConfigurationPolicy. In "musthave" mode, the operator must be present on the cluster as specified in
the policy for the policy to be marked as Compliant. In "mustnothave" mode, if the specified
operator is on the cluster (found by matching the name, namespace, source and sourceNamespace, and
optionally matching one of the specified versions), then the policy will be marked as NonCompliant.

The optional `spec.operatorGroup` section defines an
[OperatorGroup](https://github.com/operator-framework/api/blob/master/crds/operators.coreos.com_operatorgroups.yaml).
If not specified, the controller will check for an existing OperatorGroup in the namespace that can
be used. If none exists, it will create an
[AllNamespaces](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/advanced-tasks/operator-scoping-with-operatorgroups/#targetnamespaces-and-their-relationship-to-installmodes)
OperatorGroup with a generated name.

The `spec.subscription` section includes the fields from the spec of an [OLM
Subscription](https://github.com/operator-framework/api/blob/master/crds/operators.coreos.com_subscriptions.yaml).
For more information on the `config` field, see:
https://github.com/operator-framework/api/blob/v0.17.3/pkg/operators/v1alpha1/subscription_types.go#L42.
We plan to make many of these fields optional, the controller can fill in required Subscription
fields based on specified defaults in the operator's PackageManifest. For example, this allows the
default channel to possibly be different on different clusters, reflecting the default channel in
each cluster's catalog. It is not allowed to set `spec.subscription.installPlanApproval`; the policy
will determine and set a value for that field based on the policy's `spec.versions` and
`spec.upgradeApproval` settings.

In "musthave" mode, the `spec.versions` list specifies what installed versions are considered
Compliant when the policy is in `inform` mode, and which InstallPlans can be approved when in
`enforce` mode. Conversely, in "mustnothave" mode, this list specifies which versions are considered
NonCompliant. Only exact matches are considered. If the list is unset or empty, then any version on
the cluster will be considered a match. If `spec.subscription.startingCSV` is set, that version can
be approved, even if it is not in this list.

The `spec.upgradeApproval` field specifies whether an enforced "musthave" policy will approve any
upgrade InstallPlans for the operator. *It has no effect when the policy is in "mustnothave" mode*.
This only affects InstallPlans for operators that are already installed on the cluster,
which upgrade or replace the operator; initial InstallPlans for an operator can be approved
regardless of this flag. Allowed values here include `Automatic` and `None`.

Only when the policy's `spec.upgradeApproval` is set to `Automatic`, and the `spec.versions` field
is empty (allowing all versions of the operator) will the subscription managed by this policy have
its `installPlanApproval` field set to `Automatic`. Otherwise, the field will be set to `Manual`,
but it should be noted that this controller will approve InstallPlans matching the desired versions
automatically.

The `spec.removalBehavior` field allows configuration of what might be removed by the controller
when the policy is in "mustnothave" mode. *It has no effect when the policy is in "musthave" mode.*
Resources that would not be removed in `enforce` mode will not cause NonCompliance when the policy
is in `inform` mode. Status messages should reflect that those resources were kept because of the
configuration of the policy. Each kind here will support `Keep` and `Delete`, and can potentially
have additional values specific to the resources in question. For example, the OperatorGroup should
likely only be removed if it isn't being used by another subscription. 

The `spec.complianceConfig` field allows the author to specify what effect specific resource 
statuses will have on the OperatorPolicy status and compliance events. The currently planned values
are `Compliant` and `NonCompliant`, but additional values could be added in the future. For example,
when an upgrade is available for the operator, but is not in the `versions` list, the value of
`spec.complianceConfig.upgradesAvailable` is considered. When set to `Compliant`, the InstallPlan
for that upgrade would be considered Compliant in `status.relatedResources` and the policy would
have the condition `InstallPlanCompliant` be true. When set to `NonCompliant` the relatedResource
would be NonCompliant, the condition would be false, and `status.compliant` would be NonCompliant.

The default values for `spec.complianceConfig` fields should cause the policy to report as Compliant 
as long as the current instance of the operator matches a desired state specified in the policy, and
is currently healthy. In particular, it should not become NonCompliant by default when an upgrade
is available, since that does not necessarily impact the current health of the operator.

    ...
```

As required for all policies, there is a `status.compliant` field for the overall status. The status
will also have a `conditions` section, which includes the conditions from the Subscription, such as
"CatalogSourcesUnhealthy", as well a condition "DeploymentCompliant" which will reflect whether all 
of the related Deployments are available. It also includes a condition of type "Compliant", which
has a status of "True" when the policy is Compliant. The reason and message will reflect the cause
of the most recent compliance event that was emitted.

There is also a `status.relatedObjects` for the OLM objects (CatalogSource, Subscription,
InstallPlan, etc) related to this operator installation, and the Deployment(s) for the operator. 
Each of those related objects has a `compliant` field, but it should be noted that a NonCompliant
object will not necessarily cause the policy to become NonCompliant: for example if the
CatalogSource is unhealthy, `spec.complianceConfig.catalogSourceUnhealthy` must be considered. The
`reason` associated with each object is a brief human-readable explanation for the value of the
`compliant` field. This matches the conventions of ConfigurationPolicy.

When a condition changes the controller will emit a policy compliance event like other policy
controllers. In particular, the event message should begin with "Compliant; " or "NonCompliant; "
based on the `status.compliant` field, followed by an explanation of the current state. That
explanation will include information from all of the current conditions, ordered by their last
transition times, so that the most recent change is first. For the status above, the event would
look like:

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a policy user, I want to install an operator of a specific version, from a specific source, on a
managed cluster, in "AllNamespaces" mode. The policy should become compliant when the InstallPlan is
complete and all of Deployments listed in the operator's CSV are healthy.

Example yaml to apply (not including the Placement):
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: strimzi-policy
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: medium
  complianceType: musthave
  subscription:
    channel: stable
    name: strimzi-kafka-operator
    namespace: openshift-operators
    source: community-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    startingCSV: strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.0
  upgradeApproval: None
  versions:
    - strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.0
```

#### Story 2

As a policy user, I want to be able to control updates to operators so the managed clusters only use
versions that I've verified work properly. After I verify a newer version works, I should be able to
update the policy with that version, and only then should the installations on managed clusters
progress to that version.

For example, to upgrade the operator, the policy from story 1 could be updated to match this:
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: strimzi-policy
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: medium
  complianceType: musthave
  subscription:
    channel: stable
    name: strimzi-kafka-operator
    namespace: openshift-operators
    source: community-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    startingCSV: strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.0
  upgradeApproval: Automatic
  versions:
    - strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.0
    - strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.1
```

#### Story 3

As a policy user, I want to be alerted (via a NonCompliant policy) when an operator has an upgrade
available. The policy status should clearly indicate what new version is available.

The policy yaml would look like this, including some relevant fields from the status:
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: strimzi-policy
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: medium
  complianceType: musthave
  subscription:
    channel: stable
    name: strimzi-kafka-operator
    namespace: openshift-operators
    source: community-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    startingCSV: strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.0
  upgradeApproval: None
  versions:
    - strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.0
  complianceConfig:
    upgradesAvailable: NonCompliant
status:
  compliant: NonCompliant
  conditions:
    - message: ... An upgrade to strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.1 is available on the stable channel ...
      status: "False"
      type: Compliant
    - reason: RequiresApproval
      status: "False"
      type: InstallPlanCompliant
    ...
  relatedObjects:
    - compliant: NonCompliant
      object:
        apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
        kind: InstallPlan
        metadata:
          name: install-ww7c2
          namespace: openshift-operators
      reason: InstallPlan not approved
    ...
```

#### Story 4

As a policy user, I want to monitor the health of an operator installation and related objects, with
just one policy. I want the policy to be NonCompliant when the operator is not running correctly,
but I don't want to be alerted when an upgrade is available or the catalog source is unhealthy.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: strimzi-policy
spec:
  remediationAction: inform
  severity: medium
  complianceType: musthave
  subscription:
    channel: stable
    name: strimzi-kafka-operator
    namespace: openshift-operators
    source: community-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  upgradeApproval: Automatic
  complianceConfig:
    catalogSourceUnhealthy: Compliant
    deploymentsUnavailable: NonCompliant
    upgradesAvailable: Compliant
```

The `status` of this policy will be populated with details about the OperatorGroup, Subscription,
CatalogSource, ClusterServiceVersion, and InstallPlan, as well as the Deployments that are listed in
the CSV.

#### Story 5

As a policy user, I want to install an operator to a specific namespace via a policy. The policy
should become Compliant when the operator Deployments are fully available.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: strimzi-policy
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: medium
  complianceType: musthave
  operatorGroup:
    name: og-strimzi
    namespace: strimzi-app-one
    target:
      namespaces:
        - strimzi-app-one
  subscription:
    channel: stable
    name: strimzi-kafka-operator
    namespace: strimzi-app-one
    source: community-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  upgradeApproval: Automatic
```

#### Story 6

As a policy user, I want to ensure a certain operator is not on the cluster. When enforced, objects
should be deleted based on what I specify in `spec.removalBehavior`.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: strimzi-policy
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: medium
  complianceType: mustnothave
  subscription:
    channel: stable
    name: strimzi-kafka-operator
    namespace: strimzi-app-one
    source: community-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  upgradeApproval: Automatic
  removalBehavior:
    operatorGroups: DeleteIfUnused
    subscriptions: Delete
    clusterServiceVersions: Delete
    installPlans: Keep
    customResourceDefinitions: Keep
```

It should be noted that the `removalBehavior` specified here is just the default setting made
explicit.

#### Story 7

As a policy user, I want to ensure that a certain version of an operator is not present on the
cluster. If that version of the operator is found, I want its installation to be deleted.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: OperatorPolicy
metadata:
  name: strimzi-policy
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: medium
  complianceType: mustnothave
  subscription:
    channel: stable
    name: strimzi-kafka-operator
    namespace: strimzi-app-one
    source: community-operators
    sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  upgradeApproval: Automatic
  versions:
    - "strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.35.0"
  removalBehavior:
    operatorGroups: DeleteIfUnused
    subscriptions: Delete
    clusterServiceVersions: Delete
    installPlans: Keep
    customResourceDefinitions: Keep
```

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

#### Implementation of Pruning

Originally, we planned to use finalizers to remove the operator when the policy is deleted. But,
with some more experience with that feature in ConfigurationPolicy, we believe it is not the most
reliable method. It is not obvious that removing a policy should remove those resources; it requires
some policy expertise. Additionally, because policies are distributed through Placements, there are
many potential ways the policy could be removed from a cluster unexpectedly.

We are currently only planning a "mustnothave" mode, simliar to what was originally released for
ConfigurationPolicy. If a user wants to remove the operator, they can switch the policy to that
mode, and wait for it to become compliant. This also allows for a better reporting of this status:
when a policy is deleted, how can it report if a resource it is trying to delete gets stuck?

#### Status and Compliance Event

What is specified in this doc for the status and the event is meant to match what is already being
done in other policy controllers (with the addition of conditions, which are not implemented in
other controllers). If this spec disagrees with what is being done in other controllers, the
behavior of the established controllers should be used.

#### Approving InstallPlans

InstallPlans have ownerReferences to all Subscriptions in that namespace, regardless of whether or
not those operators would be upgraded or installed by the InstallPlan. Additionally, when multiple
operators have updates or new installations, OLM might create one InstallPlan for resources
specified by any or all of those operators. It should also be noted that if *any* Subscriptions in
the namespace have `installPlanApproval: Manual`, then *no* InstallPlans in the namespace will be
automatically approved by OLM.

Initially, we plan to only approve InstallPlans dealing with one operator: if an OperatorPolicy
exists for that operator, and the version to be installed is allowed by that policy's `versions`
setting, then that InstallPlan will be approved. If an InstallPlan is created for multiple operator
installations, it will not be approved by this controller, and it might cause an OperatorPolicy to
become NonCompliant.

#### Addition of the upgradesApproval field

An initial implementation *required* `spec.subscription.installPlanApproval` to be set to either
`Automatic` or `Manual`, but that setting was believed to be confusing. When set to `Automatic`, the
contoller needed to override that setting in the Subscription in order to restrict the possible
upgrades, and approve any upgrades matching the `versions` specified in the policy. And when set to
`Manual`, the controller would still approve those upgrades without user input, ie "automatically".

This potential confusion is resolved by *forbidding* the user from setting the 
`spec.subscription.installPlanApproval` field in the subscription, while providing a similar setting
via `spec.upgradeApproval`. The revised design provides more details on the interactions of this
setting and the other fields. This provides more control to the user, since they can then separate
the initial install approval from any future upgrades.

In general, adding a required field could be considered a breaking change, but here we will *not*
increment the API version. Instead, the controller will validate that the new field is set properly,
and that `spec.subscription.installPlanApproval` is not set. "Old" instances of an OperatorPolicy
which do not follow the new requirements will be NonCompliant, and explain the required change.

#### Change to default compliance regarding available upgrades

In an initial implementation, the policy would become NonCompliant if an upgrade was available, or
if the CatalogSource was unhealthy. While `complianceConfig` was being implemented, that default
behavior was examined more closely, and was changed to what is now reflected in this document.

The original design also referred to this field as `statusConfig` and was inconsistent in the
possible allowed values. `Compliant` and `NonCompliant` are believed to be the most clear options,
with `StatusMessageOnly` and `Condition` removed for not being particularly obvious. As a possible
future enhancement, a `Warning` option could be added, with exact behavior yet to be determined.
