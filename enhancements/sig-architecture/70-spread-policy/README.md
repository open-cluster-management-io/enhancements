Spread Policy across Failure-domains in Placement APIs
---

## Summary
This document proposes relevant API and code changes to apply for the OCM project [Topology-aware scheduling in cloud-native multi-cluster/multi-cloud environments](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/#/org/prodetail/221390086) in OSPP 2022.
This work is based on [previous community discussions](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/issues/49#issuecomment-857743027) on spread policy with several modifications.

## Background
Modern cloud providers typically provide K8s clusters in different datacenters and cities.
Besides, as a user, a company may want to use clusters from different providers plus some self-hosted clusters.
Here, three failure domains appeared (i.e., zone, region, and provider).
To achieve fault-tolerance and better resource utilization, it is natural that users want to distribute workloads among these failure domains using a spread policy.

K8s itself supports spread policy (by [PodTopologySpread](https://web.archive.org/web/20200507113854/https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/05/introducing-podtopologyspread/)).
The support on other multicluster management systems [like Karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/1646) is on the way. Hence, it seems necessary for OCM to support a spread policy.

## Motivation
In this section, some use cases will be presented to motivate potential features we need for spread policy.
Generally, by using the spread policy, we want to spread the workload across different failure domains.

Through this document, the following failure domain topology is used for example.

<table align="center">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Provider</th>
    <th>Region</th>
    <th>Zone</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">aws</td>
    <td rowspan="2">us-east</td>
    <td>us-east-1a</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>us-east-1b</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>us-west</td>
    <td>us-west-1a</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>alibaba<br></td>
    <td>cn-hangzhou</td>
    <td>cn-hangzhou-e</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Use Case 1: User-defined Topology of Failure Domains

Different companies may manage clusters with different topology structures of failure domains.
Hence, we use labels or claims to denote the failure domain where a ManagedCluster belongs.
The label key is named topology key.
Notably, all examples will be given with labels in this document.

**Example.** A company with only self-hosted clusters may only have “region” and “zone” labels for the clusters, while a company that also uses the public cloud has an extra “provider”.

### Use Case 2: Even Spread

The most intuitional way to spread the workload within a topology key is to break the workload into several identical parts and assign each failure domain the same number of parts.
In the model of OCM Placement, this means that we need to select the same numbers of clusters for use from the different failure domains within the same topology key.

**Example.** We have a backend service to deploy in the clusters located in the region us-east.
We want to spread the workload across the zones to achieve disaster tolerance, and we need four clusters in total.
The final placement decision should contain two from us-east-1a and other two from us-east-1b.

### Use Case 3: Max Skew

When the even spread is unsatisfiable to a certain degree, we may want the scheduler to generate a placement decision whose skew do not exceed the degree.

**Example.** We want a even spread across the zones in us-east (i.e., us-east-1a and us-east-1b) and four clusters in total.
If us-east-1a can provide three clusters and us-east-1b can only provide one cluster, then the even spread cannot be satisfied strictly.
Following K8s's PodTopologySpread, we define the skew of a topoloy to be selected_clusters_in_current_topology - **min** selected_clusters_in_a_topology.
For the above example, max skew is 3 - 1 = 2.

If we want the max skew to be 1, then the scheduling result may contain less clusters (like 2 clusters from us-east-1a and 1 cluster from us-east-1b) to ensure the max skew. 

### Use Case 4: Joint Spread

To express hierarchical topology structure, clusters are labeled with multiple topology keys (i.e., region, zone, etc.), we want them to work jointly to determine the spread decision.

**Example.** We want four clusters from aws to put our backend service.
Further, we want to spread the workload first across regions and then across zones.
Assuming all zones here can provide enough clusters.
Then, the scheduling result should contain one cluster from us-east-1a, one cluster from us-east-1b, and other two clusters from us-west-1a.

### Use Case 5: Spread with Ratio (Out of Scope)

Sometimes, we may need to spread the workload with a specified ratio.
Let us consider a scenario where most of the access to the workload is from the east coast of the US, even spread between us-east and us-west would be inappropriate.
Instead, we want to place more workload on us-east than us-west.
Besides, we want to control such preferences by user-specified configurations.

**Example.** We want six clusters to deploy our backend service.
Moreover, we want 2/3 of them to be located in us-east and 1/3 to be located in us-west since there are more clients from the east coast of the US.

## Goal
Generally, we have two goals for the spread policy:
1. Cover the full functionality in the Motivation section;
2. Implement a high-performance and scalable mechanism that works for thousands of clusters efficiently.

### Implementation
The current scheduling framework contains two types of plugins, i.e., `Filter`s and `Prioritizer`s. 
`Filter`s are invoked *before* `Prioritizer`s to handle hard constrains, filtering the clusters. 
Then, the `Prioritizer`s score the clusters.
To implement `maxSkew` (with `whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule`), we need to first score the clusters (i.e., do the spread), then ensure the `maxSkew` is not exceeded by some filter-like operations for hard constraints.
This cannot be implemented in the current framework.
Hence, a new plugin type, `Selector`, is proposed to implement hard constrains *after* `Prioritizer`s.
The `Selector` interface is showed below.

```go
// Selector defines a selector plugin that selects clusters after scoring them.
type Selector interface {
	Plugin

	// Select returns the selected clusters.
	Select(ctx context.Context, placement *clusterapiv1beta1.Placement, scores map[string]int64, clusters []*clusterapiv1.ManagedCluster) (PluginSelectResult, *framework.Status)
}

// PluginSelectResult contains the details of a select plugin result.
type PluginSelectResult struct {
	// Selected contains the selected ManagedCluster.
	Selected []*clusterapiv1.ManagedCluster
}
```

Then, a `EvenSpreadSelector` will run the following steps (each step is called `selectOne`) n times to select n clusters:

1. Exclude the clusters whose selection would cause the violation to `maxSkew` (with `whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule`).  

2. Calculate the spread score of each cluster according to the current skew.  

3. Sum the spread scores and the scores from Prioritizers, and select the cluster with highest final score.  

### Implementation Example

We have the following five clusters.
And we now want to select two clusters and ensure a even spread first across the regions then across the zones.
For regions, we don't want to set the max skew.
But for zones, we want to set the max skew to 1, and `whenUnsatisfiable` to `DoNotSchedule`.

| Cluster Name | Prioritizer Score | Region  | Zone       |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| c1           | 50                | us-east | us-east-1a |
| c2           | 50                | us-east | us-east-1a |
| c3           | 0                 | us-east | us-east-1b |
| c4           | 0                 | us-west | us-west-1a |
| c5           | 50                | us-west | us-west-1a |

The selection algorithm first runs `selectOne` to select cluster c1.
(The selecting process of cluster c1 is not described here as we focus on the selecting process of the next cluster to demonstrate the algorithm.)
Then, we get some information about the topologies and their already selected clusters (the selected count table).

| Topology Tuple        | Selected Count |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| (us-east, *)          | 1              |
| (us-east, us-east-1a) | 1              |
| (us-east, us-east-1b) | 0              |
| (us-west, *)          | 0              |
| (us-west, us-west-1a) | 0              |

Note that in the table, we organize the topology hierarchy into topology tuples according to:

> ... ensure a even spread first across the regions then across the zones.

Hence, two regions can have a zone with the same name. The algorithm can distinguish them.

We then want to run `selectOne` the second time to get the second cluster.  

**1. Exclude the clusters whose selection would cause the violation to `maxSkew` (with `whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule`).**  

We exclude cluster c2 since if we select it, we will get a selected count table:

| Topology              | Selected Count |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| (us-east, *)          | 2              |
| (us-east, us-east-1a) | 2              |
| (us-east, us-east-1b) | 0              |
| (us-west, *)          | 0              |
| (us-west, us-west-1a) | 0              |

In the table, we can see that the skew for the zones under the region us-east is two, which exceeds one and violates the max skew constraint.

**2. Calculate the spread score of each cluster according to the current skew.**  

For cluster c3, c4 and c5, we calculate their spread scores.
Since the clusters are organized by regions and zones, we have two scores for a cluster (i.e., the region score and the zone score).
The calculation of them follows a rationale that a cluster in a topology which have less selected count in the selected count table will have a higher score (for zones, this is only valid for the ones in the same region).
The score range is `[0, 63]` (i.e., `[0b000000, 0b111111]`).
We get:

| Cluster Name | Region Score | Zone Score |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| c3           | 0            | 63         |
| c4           | 63           | 0          |
| c5           | 63           | 0          |

We want to get a single score for each cluster from the region score and the zone score.
Because

> ... ensure a even spread first across the regions then across the zones.

, we think a higher region score is of more importance than a higher zone score.
For two clusters, we only compare their zone scores when they have the same region score.
Hence, the final score is calculated by `region_score << 6 + zone_score`.
We use `6` here since the max region score or the max zone score `63` can be present in a 6-bit int.
We get:

| Cluster Name | Spread Score |
|--------------|--------------|
| c3           | 63           |
| c4           | 4032         |
| c5           | 4032         |

We further normalize the spread scores to `[-100, 100]` since we will later add them with the scores from priorizizers.
We get:

| Cluster Name | Spread Score (Normalized) |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| c3           | -100                      |
| c4           | 100                       |
| c5           | 100                       |

**3. Sum the spread scores and the scores from Prioritizers, and select the cluster with highest final score.**  

Here, we need a weight of the spread selector. If it is two:

| Cluster Name | Spread Score (Normalized) | Prioritizer Score | Final Score   |
|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| c3           | -100                      | 0                 | -100*2+0=-200 |
| c4           | 100                       | 0                 | 100*2+0=200   |
| c5           | 100                       | 50                | 100*2+50=250  |

Hence, for this `selectOne`, we select cluster c5.
