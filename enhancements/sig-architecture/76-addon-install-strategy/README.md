## Release Signoff Checklist

## Summary

This proposal is to propose an enhancement of the `ClusterManagementAddon` API, so user can configure which clusters the related
`ManagedClusterAddon` should be enabled.

## Motivation

We are seeing requirements that user would like the addon to be automatically installed when
a new cluster is registered. We provided a [installStrategy interface](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework/blob/main/pkg/agent/inteface.go#L56)
in `addon-framework`, so the addon developer can select to automatically enable the `ManagedClusterAddon` in all or selected clusters. 
However, this mechanism is not user friendly: 
- An addon user cannot easily change the install strategy. For example, the user may want to disable the addon in certain clusters by deleting `ManagedClusterAddon`, but the addon-manager would recreate it.
- It also confuses the addon developers, since we do not have an API standard to define the install strategy.

### Goals

- Enhance `ClusterManagementAddon` API to allow user to configure addon install strategy
- A centralized addon-install-controller on hub being responsible of creation/deletion of `ManagedClusterAddon`

### Non-Goals

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

The admin can configure the `ClusterManagementAddon` API to automatically install a `ManagedClusterAddon` in all clusters
or selected clusters.

#### Story 2

The admin can select NOT to install a `ManagedClusterAddon` in one or several clusters.

#### Story 3

The addon developer should not care about which cluster the `ManagedClusterAddon` should be installed.

## Design Details

### ClusterManagementAddon API change

```go
type InstallStrategy struct {
	// Type is the type of the install strategy, it can be:
	// - Manual: no automatic install
	// - Placements: install to clusters selected by placements.
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Enum=Manual;Placements
	// +kubebuilder:default:=Manual
	Type string `json:"type"`

	// Placements is a list of placement references honored when install strategy type is
	// Placements. All clusters selected by these placements will install the addon
	// +listType=map
	// +listMapKey=name
	// +listMapKey=namespace
	Placements[] PlacementStrategy `json:"placements,omitempty"`
}

type PlacementStrategy {
	// Placement is the reference to a placement
	Placement PlacementRef `json:",inline"`
	
	// AddonAgent is the configuration of managedClusterAddon during installation.
	// User can override the configuration by updating the managedClusterAddon directly.
	AddonAgent AddonAgentConfig `json:"addonAgent,omitempty"`
}

type PlacementRef struct {
	// Name of the placement
	// +required
	Name string `json:"name"`

	// Namespace of the placement
	// +required
	Namespace string `json:"space"`
}

type AddonAgentConfig struct {
	// InstallNamespace is the namespace to install the agent on spoke cluster.
	InstallNamespace string `json:"addonAgent"`
}
```

### Install addon according to a placement

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementAddOn
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  installStrategy:
    type: Placements
    placements:
    - name: aws-placement
      namespace: default
```

- when a cluster is added into the related `PlacementDecision`, the `ManagedClusterAddon` will be created on the cluster namespace.
- when a cluster is removed from the related `PlacementDecision`, the `ManagedClusterAddon` will be deleted on the cluster namespace.

### Install addons based on multiple placements

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementAddOn
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  installStrategy:
    type: Placements
    placements:
    - name: aws-placement
      namespace: default
      addonAgent:
        installNamespace: aws-addon-ns
    - name: gcp-placement
      namespace: default
      addonAgent:
        installNamespace: gcp-addon-ns
```

This will ensure that addon agents installed in aws are deployed in aws-addon-ns namespace
while addon installed in gcp in gcp-addon-ns. If the user updates the `installNamespace` of a certain `ManagedClusterAddon`, 
it will NOT be reverted based on the configs in `ClusterManagementAddon`.

### Disable addon in some clusters

At first change the install strategy to `Manual`

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterManagementAddOn
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  installStrategy:
    type: Manual
```

Then admin can delete `ManagedClusterAddon` in certain cluster namespaces.

When the user changes the strategy type from `Placement` to `Manual`, all the created are `ManagedClusterAddon` is kept. `ManagedClusterAddon`
will not be auto-created or deleted anymore.

When the user changes the strategy type from `Manual` to `Placement`, `ManagedClusterAddon` created manually by the the user will NOT be
overriden by the configuration on the `ClusterManagementAddon`.

### Addon Install Controller

We need to build and run a centralized addon install controller on the hub cluster. The addon
install controller will create/delete `ManagedClusterAddon` according to the install strategy
in related `ClusterManagementAddon`. The addon install controller will:
- create or delete but not modify the `ManagedClusterAddon` if it exists already.
- do not create when the `ManagedCluster` is deleting.
- delete all `ManagedClusterAddon` in the cluster namespace when the `ManagedCluster` is deleting.

### Test Plan

- e2e test on using cluster label selector type
- e2e test on using placements type
- e2e test on using manual type

### Graduation Criteria

TBD

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Addon-framework needs to be upgraded for the addons. The original `InstallStrategy` interface in addon-framework will be marked as deprecated.
If the old addon has not adopted the new API change and still use the `InstallStrategy` interface in addon-framework, the `installStrategy`
set in `ClusterManagementAddon` MUST be Manual.

If an addon upgrade to use the new addon-framework, the related `ClusterManagementAddon` should also be updated to use the appropriate
`installStrategy`.
