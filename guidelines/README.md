# Metadata
Start by filling out the [metadata template](metadata.yaml) for this enhancement.
This will be used to support tooling around filtering and display.  It is also
critical to clearly communicate the status of a proposal.

* **title** Required
  * The title of the proposal in plain language.
    This is the title of the enhancement. Keep it simple and descriptive. A good
    title can help communicate what the enhancement is and should be considered as
    part of any review.

The YAML `title` should be lowercased and spaces/punctuation should be
replaced with `-`.
* **status** Required
  * The current state of the proposal.
  * Must be one of `provisional`, `implementable`, `implemented`, `deferred`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`, or `replaced`.
* **authors** Required
  * A list of authors of the proposal.
    This is simply the GitHub ID.
* **reviewers** Required
  * Reviewer(s) chosen after triage, according to the proposal process.
  * If not yet chosen, replace with `TBD`.
  * Same name/contact scheme as `authors`.
  * Reviewers should be a distinct set from authors.
* **approvers** Required
  * Approver(s) chosen after triage, according to the proposal process.
  * Approver(s) are drawn from the sig-architect.
    It is up to the sig-architect to determine how they pick approvers for proposals impacting them.
    The approvers are speaking for the work group in the process of approving this proposal.
  * The approvers are the individuals who decide when to move this proposal to the `implementable` state.
  * Approvers should be a distinct set from authors.
  * If not yet chosen, replace with `TBD`.
  * Same name/contact scheme as `authors`.
* **creation-date** Required
  * The date that the proposal was first submitted in a PR.
  * In the form `yyyy-mm-dd`.
* **last-updated** Optional
  * The date that the proposal was last changed significantly.
  * In the form `yyyy-mm-dd`.
* **see-also** Optional
  * A list of other proposaals that are relevant to this proposal.
  * In the form `Proposal-123`.
* **replaces** Optional
  * A list of proposals that this proposal replaces.  Those proposals should list this proposal in
    their `superseded-by`.
  * In the form `Proposal-123`.
* **superseded-by**
  * A list of proposals that supersede this proposal. Use of this should be paired with
    this proposal moving into the `Replaced` status.
  * In the form `Proposal-123`.

# Neat Enhancement Idea
To get started with this template:
1. **Pick a domain.** Find the appropriate domain to discuss your enhancement.
1. **Make a copy of this template.** Copy this template into the directory for
   the domain.
1. **Fill out the "overview" sections.** This includes the Summary and
   Motivation sections. These should be easy and explain why the community
   should desire this enhancement.
1. **Create a PR in the Enhacements repo.** Assign it to folks with expertise in that
   domain to help sponsor the process.
1. **Merge at each milestone.** Merge when the design is able to transition to a
   new status (provisional, implementable, implemented, etc.). View anything
   marked as `provisional` as an idea worth exploring in the future, but not
   accepted as ready to execute. Anything marked as `implementable` should
   clearly communicate how an enhancement is coded up and delivered. If an
   enhancement describes a new deployment topology or platform, include a
   logical description for the deployment, and how it handles the unique aspects
   of the platform. Aim for single topic PRs to keep discussions focused. If you
   disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR with suggested
   changes.

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [website](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/website/)

## Summary

The `Summary` section is incredibly important for producing high quality
user-focused documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It
should be possible to collect this information before implementation begins in
order to avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing
release notes and implementing the feature itself. 

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

## Motivation

This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this proposal. Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.

### Goals

List the specific goals of the proposal. How will we know that this has succeeded?

### Non-Goals

What is out of scope for this proposal? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.

## Proposal

This is where we get down to the nitty gritty of what the proposal actually is.

### User Stories

Detail the things that people will be able to do if this is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

What are the caveats to the implementation? What are some important details that
didn't come across above. Go in to as much detail as necessary here. This might
be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.

### Risks and Mitigations

What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate. Think broadly. For
example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger OKD
ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed and by whom? How will UX be reviewed and by whom?

Consider including folks that also work outside your immediate sub-project.

## Design Details

### Open Questions [optional]

This is where to call out areas of the design that require closure before deciding
to implement the design.  For instance, 
 > 1. This requires exposing previously private resources which contain sensitive
  information.  Can we do this? 

### Test Plan

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly
challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). 

All code is expected to have sufficient e2e tests.

### Graduation Criteria

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. Initial proposal
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this
enhancement:

- [Maturity levels][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning),
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general, we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, stable), regardless how the functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure this
is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade in order to keep previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade in order to make use of the enhancement?

Upgrade expectations:
- Each component should remain available for user requests and
  workloads during upgrades. Any exception to this should be
  identified and discussed here.
- Micro version upgrades - users should be able to skip forward versions within a
  minor release stream without being required to pass through intermediate
  versions - i.e. `x.y.N->x.y.N+2` should work without requiring `x.y.N->x.y.N+1`
  as an intermediate step.
- Minor version upgrades - you only need to support `x.N->x.N+1` upgrade
  steps. So, for example, it is acceptable to require a user running 0.1.0 to
  upgrade to 0.3.0 with a `0.1.0->0.2.0` step followed by a `0.2.0->0.3.0` step.
- While an upgrade is in progress, new component versions should
  continue to operate correctly in concert with older component
  versions (aka "version skew"). For example, if an agent operator on a managed cluster 
  is rolling out a new agent, the old and new agent in different managed clusters
  must continue to work correctly with old or new version of the hub while hub and agents
  remain in this partially upgraded state for some time.

Downgrade expectations:
- If an `N->N+1` upgrade fails mid-way through, or if the `N+1` agent is
  misbehaving, it should be possible for the user to rollback to `N`. It is
  acceptable to require some documented manual steps in order to fully restore
  the downgraded agent to its previous state. Examples of acceptable steps
  include:
  - Deleting any resources added by the new version of the agent operator in the
    managed cluster. The agent operator does not currently delete resources that 
    no longer exist in the target version.

### Version Skew Strategy

How will the component handle version skew with other components?
What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- During an upgrade, we will always have skew among components, how will this impact your work?
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the hub and
  in the klusterlet? How does an n-2 klusterlet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the managed cluster change? For example, changes to infrastructure
  configurartion of the managed cluster may be needed before the updading klusterlet or other
  agent components.

## Implementation History

Major milestones in the life cycle of a proposal should be tracked in `Implementation
History`.

## Drawbacks

The idea is to find the best form of an argument why this enhancement should _not_ be implemented.

## Alternatives

Similar to the `Drawbacks` section the `Alternatives` section is used to
highlight and record other possible approaches to delivering the value proposed
by an enhancement.

## Infrastructure Needed [optional]

Use this section if you need things from the project. Examples include a new
subproject, repos requested, github details, and/or testing infrastructure.

Listing these here allows the community to get the process for these resources
started right away.
